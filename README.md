# IT BI System
I have worked as a BI Developer for this project which uses Power BI, Dax, MS SQL Server tools to develop a BI system that analyze a company`s IT help desk tickets data and extract many data insights that can help to measure the performance of IT help desk team and identify the recommended actions to improve it.
